Hi! I'm Hans Engel. I work as a web developer on all sorts of geekery. On this blog I'll post any sorts of interesting technical topics I come across during my work or during my free time. You can also expect from me an occasional detour into linguistics or philosophy.

Find me on:

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/176075/hans-engel)
* [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5092154-hans-engel)

Please excuse this stub of a page &mdash; I intend to improve it in the very near future. In the meantime, if you'd like to get to know me, [send me an email](mailto:engel@engel.uk.to)!
